The app satisfies:

- Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

- Each timeblock is color-coded based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

- Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

- Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
